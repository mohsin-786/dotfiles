#Cluster:
Cluster is a collection of Control Plane and worker nodes.
kubectl is a command line tool which communicates with the Control Plane.
Worker nodes is a node where applications or micro-services are running whichgets assigned by the Control Plane

#Kubernetes Pod:
It's a scheduling unit.
{ 1. Create applications into a microservice.
  2. Add every microservice in a container.
  3. Put container in its pods.
  4. Deploy these pods to controllers such as Deployment controllers(built-in controller of K8s)
     (Controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed.Each controller tries to move 
      the current cluster state to the desired state)
}


#Control Plane:
Collection of various components that help us in managing the overall health of the cluster.
Like setting up new pod, creating new pod, scale pod, destroy, expose etc. is managed by Control Plane

Architecture:
Components:

1) API Server: kubectl communicates with this server like giving commands to do something. All communications happens via this server.

2) etcd: it's a database that stores info of clusters.

3) Controller Manager: It manages:
		- Desired State
		- Current State
		- Differences
		- Make changes

4) Scheduler: It physically schedules the objects and stuffs.
	      Scheduler will schedule it on the worker nodes




#Architecture of worker nodes:

1) kube-proxy:It is responsible for networking. It will make sure that every worker node we have will get its own IP address.

2)kubelet: Its on every worker node. It will listen to the API server. Whenever a new worker node is created and attached to the control plane, kubelet will be installed on it.

3)container runtime:
